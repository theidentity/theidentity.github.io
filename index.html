                            I'm an AI researcher focused on building algorithms and tools aiming to advance healthcare through technology. I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Toronto, advised by
                            <a href="https://mcintoshml.github.io/index.html">Dr. Chris McIntosh</a> and
                            <a href="https://brudno.uhndata.io/"> Dr. Michael Brudno</a> where my research revolves around developing algorithms that address biases in AI models applied to medical data. A very special shoutout to the

                        <h3>Research Interests</h3>
                        <p>
                            My primary research focus is on identifying and combating data biases and the phenomenon of shortcut learning in AI/healthcare models. I build algorithms for reducing the reliance of bias and spurious confounders and shortcuts of AI models for healthcare tasks. I'm interested in putting together new healthcare datasets (especially from developing nations) and building systems that improve healthcare pipelines and enable a more equitable utilization of AI tools.
                        </p>
                        <p>I'm also interested in putting my engineering and research skills to use. If you have tasks which have a large amount of unlabelled data, please reach out. I have some expreience with semi-supervised algorithms and building human in loop AI augment annotation pipelines.</p>

                        <p>On the other end of the spectrum, if you have very little data, I'm interested in utilizing generative models for data augmentation and generation.</p>

The fellowship supports my work on debiasing AI models in healthcare.</li>
                            <li>Our paper "<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01118-4">Shortcut Learning in Medical AI Hinders Generalization</a>" has been accepted at Nature Digital Medicine. We have also publicly released <a href="https://github.com/mcintoshML/Data-Bias-Analysis">our code</a> which allows researchers to estimate the generalization of their AI models without external data.</li>
